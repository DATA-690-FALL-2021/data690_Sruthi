### What have I learned throughout the process?

  1. The tool helps in analyzing the data easily, it enables insightful information delivery of higher overall quality and relevance, it is
  easy-to-use collaborative functions to analyze data and increase productivity.
  
  2. firstly, I have taken the time series www usage data and then checked if it had any null values, this can be done by a single click or 
  by dragging and dropping the data in the work space
  
  3. Secondly, I have used data processing techniques like joining data, modifying data and validation rules.

  4. While joining data we can check for none values by checking the nan box without writing the code, this helps removing the null values out and 
  later we can either join the whole data or only values 
  
  5. we can also use methods like binomial, multi-nominal and distribution which come under one sample distribution data, it is easy to use
  and all the constarints are mentioned in the description and finally the reports are generated which speicfy its functionality.
