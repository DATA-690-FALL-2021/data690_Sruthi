## INTRODUCTION:

#### WHY THIS TOPIC?
   - Gender equality is a core development objective in its own right. 
   - It is also smart development policy and sound business practice. It is integral to economic growth, business growth and good development outcomes. 
   - Gender equality can boost productivity, enhance prospects for the next generation, build resilience, and make institutions more representative and effective. 
   - I also wanted to look into the health sector, especially regarding female feticide which is one of the most disheartening things Iâ€™ve read in most of the articles when it comes to gender bias.

#### WHY THESE INDICATORS?
   - As i mentioned before i wanted to compare the number of infant deaths of female with male and its cause 
   - Next i wanted to compare the quality of education given to a girl child with the male child.
   - Later, i wanted to analyze if equal rights are given to both female and male employees during retirement.
   - I have also looked into the employment rate between men and women
   - Lastly, i have checked the time spent by both the genders on domestic work in the household.

### INFANT DEATHS RECORDED:
 - Feticide is one of the biggest crimes noted in countries like India and Afghanisthan, this helps us understand how many kids have died because of feticide.
 - In the below scatter plot we observe that it registered the most in India, irrespective of the gender though the reason is unkown here, the number of infant deaths is highest in India.
